Console App

2 programs, one of which is the Coin Toss Simulator and the other being Slot Machine Simulator. Coin Toss Simulator will generate the number of (user-input) times of 
coin flips and display how many heads and tails were resulted. The Slot Machine Simulator is a gambling device that the user inserts money into and then pulls a lever (or presses a button). The slot machine then displays a set of random images. If two or more of the images matches, the user wins an amount of money that the slot machine dispenses back to the user.
